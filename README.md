We decided to change our user story to include more of the people who would be watching the presentation!

It’s Friday, you’ve made it through the week! You may have suffered any of the following; annoying colleagues, oppressive bosses, pints of baby sick, or maybe just had a week that you need to leave behind! You need a drink! You want something new, not the same, boring can of lager. This website will give you lots of ideas for delicious cocktails to help you relax after a hard week of being you! Don’t fancy making it yourself? Leave it to the pros and find a cocktail bar near you!

## Motivation
This application is born from 3 mums who were desperate for a relaxing weekend! We wanted to enjoy something different, either making a new drink at home or going somewhere new! We designed this application to search for cocktail recipes to make at home and cocktail bars near us!

The original ideas are shown in the wireframe below. 

Our first Wireframe shows our initial ideas and basic flow of our page

Our second Wireframe includes colour palettes and font options as well as image inspiration and another iteration of out layout.

## Usage

Upon loading the application the user is faced with the following page;

![Screenshot of landing area](./assets/images/screenshot-landing-area.png)

Underneath the main banner is a countdown timer to Friday when the weekend begins!

There are 2 tabs, 'Night In' and 'Night Out'.

1. When a user lands on the page they will see the 'Night In' content. The user can click a button to get a surprise cocktail, as shown below,

The card containing the cocktail shows the name, ingredients, measure, photograph and instructions to make the cocktail. 

When a user then scrolls to the bottom of the information they can save the information to favourites in the footer, as shown below.

2. A user can also search for a cocktail by name, as shown below, 

![Screenshot of search by name function](./assets/images/screenshot-search-by-name.png)

3. The user can also search by ingredient and is then presented with a list of 10 cocktails that contain that ingredient, as shown below,

4. When the user clicks a cocktail on the list, then are presented with a card as before containing the cocktail details. 


## Challenges

These are the challenges we faced were numerous! We tried initially to include a map in the 'out' tab and then append the cocktail bard to the map - but this unfortunately doesn't work yet! 
We had problems styling the dynamic buttons. We had problems finding APIs that it was possible to use without key issues. 
We tried to create an autocomplete for the search box and create a list for the user, but this was restricted by the API version available to us.
