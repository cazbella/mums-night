## Motivation
This application is born from 3 mums who were desperate for a relaxing weekend! We wanted to enjoy something different, either making a new drink at home or going somewhere new! We designed this application to search for cocktail recipes to make at home and cocktail bars near us!

The original ideas are shown in the wireframe below. 

Our first Wireframe shows our initial ideas and basic flow of our page

Our second Wireframe includes colour palettes and font options as well as image inspiration and another iteration of out layout.

## Usage

Upon loading the application the user is faced with the following page;

![Screenshot of landing area](./assets/images/screenshot-landing-area.png)

Underneath the main banner is a countdown timer to Friday when the weekend begins!

There are 2 tabs, 'Night In' and 'Night Out'.

1. When a user lands on the page they will see the 'Night In' content. The user can click a button to get a surprise cocktail, as shown below,

The card containing the cocktail shows the name, ingredients, measure, photograph and instructions to make the cocktail. 

When a user then scrolls to the bottom of the information they can save the information to favourites in the footer, as shown below.

2. A user can also search for a cocktail by name, as shown below,

3. The user can also search by ingredient and is then presented with a list of 10 cocktails that contain that ingredient, as shown below,
